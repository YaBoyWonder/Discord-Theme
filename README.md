# Discord-Theme
This is a discord theme I edited and played around and in my opinion made much better.
To install this You must have BeautifulDiscord or Better Discord

Once installed, then there should be an area in your settings where you can input your own css code

In that area, copy all the code (from the wondertheme) input it into your discord and then save it (depending on what your using)

And then "boom" Discord should be changed and much better! :D
