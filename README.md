# Discord-Theme
This is a discord theme I edited and played around and in my opinion made much better.
To install this You must have BeautfiulDiscord or Better Discord

Once installed, then there should be an area where you can input your own css code

In that area, copy the code (all of it) and then save it (depending on what your using)

And then "boom" Discord should be changed and much better! :D
